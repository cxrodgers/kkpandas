"""Methods for choosing times to fold on

This module defines ways of choosing trials or choosing times to fold
spikes or events on.

This is where the pipeline definition is for now as well

I'll try to keep this module agnostic to the parameters of any specific task,
but note that it uses the variables `events` and `trials_info` as loaded by
the io module.
