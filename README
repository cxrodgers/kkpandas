This project defines representations for event (or spike) times around
trials. It also provides I/O from KlustaKwik-style data files.


KlustaKwik I/O modules (independent of the rest of the project):
---
If you just want to load data and you have your own analysis functions:
    from kkpandas import kkio, KKFileSchema
    spikes = kkio.from_KK(path_to_KK_files)

I chose to use the pandas module for this because the DataFrame object is a 
rich way to deal with structured data like this, and also because the plaintext 
reading functions in pandas appear to be much faster than numpy/matplotlib 
equivalents for this application. Still you will find that the speed of 
reading plaintext is the rate-limiting step.

KKFileSchema: an object that handles interaction with filesystem to check 
for which KK files exist and does some simple error checking. Pure Python!

kkio: a module that actually does the reading of the files and formats 
them into pandas DataFrame. The main function to use for this is:
    kkpandas.from_KK(path_to_klusters_files)


There has been some drift in the KK file format specification over time. 
For instance, Klusters *requires* that the last column in the fetfile be 
the list of spike times, and that the number of features include this time, 
even though this is not a true feature of the spike. (Thanks to John Schulman 
for pointing this out.) Also, the xml file that Klusters uses disallows the 
use of a group numbered `0` and essentially insists that you start with 1.


Spiketrain Representations

base : Defines the basic data types for folding and binning across trials


Analysis Pipeline
---
pipeline : Wrapper objects controlling the analysis of spiketrains, from
selection of neurons and trials, to binning and smoothing over arbitrary
categories.

timepickers : ways to choose trials or events from trials

io : loading of event information and trial information

plotting : ways to visualize the results


Other

utility.py : efficient ways to select from DataFrame or lock to events, etc

chris.py : inherited objects specialized for my experiments
